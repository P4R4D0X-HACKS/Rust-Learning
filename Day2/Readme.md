Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the given Rust code, covering fundamental data types, compound data structures, and their usage within the context of the main and compound_datatypes functions.
Scalar Data Types

Rust offers several primitive data types to represent different kinds of values. The code demonstrates the following:
Integer Types

    Unsigned integers:
        u8: Unsigned 8-bit integer (range: 0 to 255)
        Other unsigned integer types: u16, u32, u64, u128 (not explicitly used in the code)
    Signed integers:
        i32: Signed 32-bit integer (default integer type)
        Other signed integer types: i8, i64, i128 (not explicitly used in the code)
    Architecture-specific integers:
        usize: Unsigned integer with the size of a word-sized integer
        isize: Signed integer with the size of a word-sized integer

Floating-Point Types

    f32: Single-precision floating-point number
    f64: Double-precision floating-point number

Character Type

    char: Represents a Unicode character

Boolean Type

    bool: Represents a boolean value (true or false)

Type Aliasing

    type Age = u8: Creates a new name Age for the u8 type.
    let my_age: Age = 23: Declares a variable my_age of type Age with the value 23.

Type Conversion

    let a = 10; let b = a as f64;: Converts integer a to floating-point number b using the as keyword.

Compound Data Types

Rust provides several ways to group multiple values together. The code demonstrates the following:
Strings

    &str: A string slice representing a fixed-length sequence of characters.
    String: A mutable string that can grow in size.

Arrays

    Fixed-size collections of elements of the same type.
    Accessed using indexing.
    Example: let mut array_1 = [3, 5, 6, 3, 6, 6];

Vectors

    Resizable collections of elements of the same type.
    Accessed using indexing.
    Example: let vec_1 = vec![4, 3, 2, 3, 2];

Tuples

    Collections of different data types.
    Accessed using indexing or pattern matching.
    Example: let my_info = ("Salary", 4000, "Age", 49.2);

Unit Type

    (): Represents an empty value or tuple.

Function Analysis
fn main()

    Demonstrates the usage of scalar data types, type aliasing, and type conversion.
